# Pyhton--Project---Hotel-booking Cancellation-Analysis-
# Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes hotel booking data to determine how many cancellations have occurred. 
The analysis was conducted using Python in Google Colab, leveraging libraries such as NumPy and Pandas.

## Technologies Used
- **Google Colab**: For writing and executing Python code.
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.

## Data Source
The dataset consists of hotel booking records, including details about reservations, customer information, and cancellation status.

## Key Steps in Analysis
1. **Data Loading**: Imported and explored the dataset using Pandas.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and formatted data appropriately.
3. **Data Exploration**: Used descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand trends.
4. **Cancellation Analysis**: Identified patterns and trends in cancellations.
5. **Visualization**: Used plots and charts to present findings.Various visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to understand trends in cancellations,
    Heatmaps and bar charts helped in identifying relationships between customer behavior and cancellations.

## Results & Insights
- Identified key factors influencing cancellations.
- Observed trends based on seasonality and customer type.
- Provided insights for potential business improvements.

## How to Run the Project
1. Download the Jupyter Notebook file (`.ipynb`).
2. Upload it to Google Colab.
3. Run the cells to reproduce the analysis.

## Future Enhancements
- Adding machine learning models to predict cancellations.
- Improving visualization with interactive dashboards.
- Expanding analysis with more detailed customer segmentation.
  
## Conclusion
- This project successfully demonstrated how machine learning can be applied to predict hotel booking cancellations.
- The findings provide valuable insights for hotel management to optimize their booking strategies.
